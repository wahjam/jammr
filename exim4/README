This is an exim4 SMTP relay server container image.  It listens on port 25 and
queues outgoing mail to external SMTP servers.  Do not expose port 25 to the
external network since this could be misused by spammers!

Containers wishing to send email should set this container's hostname as the
SMTP server.
