Let's Encrypt certbot image
---------------------------
This image generates and renews SSL certificates for one or more domain names.
It requires access to a "webroot" volume that is exposed by an HTTP server.
This volume is used to prove ownership of domains in the Let's Encrypt ACME
protocol.  After certificates are updated the nginx web server is reloaded in
another container.

Run the image with the following environment variables:

 * NGINX_CONTAINER_NAME: name of nginx container (used to restart nginx after
   generating/renewing SSL certificates)
 * EMAIL: contact email address for Let's Encrypt account
 * DOMAINS: comma-separated list of domain names for SSL certificate

The following volumes are used:

 * /etc/letsencrypt: certbot state and SSL certificate files
 * /var/www/certbot-webroot: webroot for ACME protocol

This image also requires that the /var/run/docker.sock socket is bind mounted
in order to reload the nginx web server in the nginx container.
