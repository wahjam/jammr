Hi {{user.username}},
Sad news! jammr will shut down on April 30th, 2025. This email explains what
will happen and why jammr is shutting down.

After April 30th, 2025 the jammr application and the website, including forum,
user account pages, and recorded jams, will cease to operate. It will not be
possible to jam using the application anymore.

Premium subscriptions will not be charged after January 31st, 2025. If you had
a subscription, your Premium features will remain active for free until
shutdown as a thank you for your support.

What steps should I take?

1. Download any recorded jams you'd like to save from
   https://jammr.net/recorded-jams/ before April 30th, 2025.
2. Discuss alternative online jamming platforms where you will migrate with
   your jamming buddies. You can do this on the https://forum.jammr.net/, on
   the https://discord.gg/xnywFszu, or in the chat during a jam session.
3. After jammr shuts down, uninstall the jammr application from your computer.

Why is jammr shutting down?

I've had the pleasure of jamming with some of you for many years and want to
express my apologies for disrupting your online jamming and the community that
has grown. I started building jammr over 12 years ago and have run it mostly by
myself throughout its lifetime. In recent years it's been a struggle to keep on
top of the operational tasks while also making progress towards the vision of
an online jamming platform that I had in mind all those years ago. Providing
the level of service that users deserve requires more time than I have
available. Having considered the options, I have decided to shut down jammr in
an orderly fashion instead of letting it fall into disrepair.

A heartfelt thank you to you for using jammr!

Stefan, founder at jammr ltd
