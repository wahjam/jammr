jammr previously announced it was shutting down on April 30th, 2025. After
several long-time users offered to help, we put together a plan to keep jammr
alive as a community project after the company jammr ltd ceases.

HighAction, netjedi, and waynematabar45 have volunteered to run jammr going
forward. Thanks to them you can keep using jammr just as you do today.

We are trying our best to minimize any disruption and ask for your patience
during this transition period. For any questions, please email info@jammr.net.

If you were a Premium subscriber in the past, your payment data is being
deleted to protect your privacy during this transition. You can fully delete
your account at any time by logging in on the website and clicking the "Delete

As always: happy jamming!
