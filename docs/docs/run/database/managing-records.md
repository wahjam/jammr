There is a web interface for managing database records. This is the standard
Django admin site that allows creating, editing, and deleting database records.
All the low-level database records related to the website, user accounts,
recorded jams, forum, etc are available.

The admin site is useful for troubleshooting and making changes when there
is no easier way to make a change. Be careful because incorrect changes could
break the website or delete important data.

Log in to the admin site at [https://jammr.net/admin/](https://jammr.net/admin/).
